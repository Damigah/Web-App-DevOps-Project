- **Data Validation:** Ensure data accuracy and completeness with required fields, date restrictions, and card number validation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For the application to succesfully run, you need to install the following packages:

- flask (version 2.2.2)
- pyodbc (version 4.0.39)
- SQLAlchemy (version 2.0.21)
- werkzeug (version 2.2.3)

### Usage

To run the application, you simply need to run the `app.py` script in this repository. Once the application starts you should be able to access it locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Here you will be meet with the following two pages:

1. **Order List Page:** Navigate to the "Order List" page to view all existing orders. Use the pagination controls to navigate between pages.

2. **Add New Order Page:** Click on the "Add New Order" tab to access the order form. Complete all required fields and ensure that your entries meet the specified criteria.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Flask is used to build the backend of the application, handling routing, data processing, and interactions with the database.

- **Frontend:** The user interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.

- **Database:** The application employs an Azure SQL Database as its database system to store order-related data.

## Progression

### Delivery Date

A delivery date column was added to the main branch into app.py and orders.html files by merging branches from feature/add-delivery-date into main. within the feature/add-delivery-date I had modified the branch to add the delivery date into both files using Visual Studio Code. After making the changes into the branch, I git add ., git commit -m "message" and utilised git push --set-upstream origin feature/add-delivery-date to set up the branch in my remote repository and git push. I made a pull request from feature/add-delivery-date into main and reviewed the changes. After being satisfied with the changes, I merge the two branches.

It was then not needed to modify the files and had to revert the changes back by using git pull first to fetch the contents in the remote repository. I made a feature branch using git branch revert-delivery-date from the main branch. I use git checkout revert-delivery-date to switch into the branch and used the git log command to find the log before merging into main. When the appropiate log was found I used git revert 23c0b3 to revert the changes and git push --set-upstream origin revert-delivery-date and git push the changes into my remote repository. I made a pull request and check the changes into the main branch before merging the two branches. I check my main branch to see the changes made.
